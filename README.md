Simple reports made by a script based on the data you provide (with reasoning).

Wallet groups for the main search were taken from my groups from the my main repository (https://github.com/maide777/l0-sybils-founder).

So keep in mind that these groups have already gone through a lot of criteria for selection, and this report is fairly simple and with a simple description.

As an example of a criterion:
All wallets make transactions at the same time (maximum 2 different transactions)
